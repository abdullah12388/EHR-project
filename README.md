# EHR-project

EHR system for all hospitals in Egypt 
Introduction:
So as we know that the Egyptian community is kind of lazy and hate to hold things on his hands and they may also lose his things but the biggest fear is that they may lose their conscious or they might have a medical issue and no one could know about it.
so our idea is based on that fear as we believe that the Egyptian citizen should feel safe and must see that there’s someone who cares about him and his health so after we did our researches we found out that there’s no one in the whole country did provide a good service to Egyptians and we feel that we have a good opportunity to achieve something -even if it is small –to the community.

Idea description:
Everyone should know his treatment (there’s no doubt on that),but we believe that you should know what is making you feeling not good enough like normal people to continue your life and you must have like a ghost doctor who is watching you and your (aghza 7ywya w )and how it’s doing well, bad or what
So our idea consists of two parts
*First one is a software:
Our system is based on having a centralized Database which will contain patient treatment history and diseases that he had and will be updated by every hospital in the country so any patient will have his history wherever he goes as he only needs 
1) No papers
2) No ID to show to anyone 
3) He/She only needs time to remember his password and ID and this will be written on his watch which he/she wears 
Before the Doctor see the patient: he can see the history of the patient and then he will see him 
at the moment of seeing the doctor: (at next steps of the project as we intend to work on it after graduation) we will help the doctor to see predictions from the history of the patient what the patient might suffer from.
After the doctor see the patient: the patient will review the hospital and we will use our calculations (Big Data) so we will show the reviews of all patients to that hospital so it will take a rank between all hospitals so there will be like a competition between all hospitals to prove that they are the best so the more good reviews they get, the more patients they get, the more money they make. 
Only Doctors or nurses (by an order from the doctor) who can update the patient information using patient ID and Password 
*Second thing is hardware one:
We will use a sensor which can measure (heartbeat, percentage of oxygen on the blood, sugar on the blood, blood pressure and adrenaline on the blood).
So this combination is tracked by the system and it will send an alarm to the hospital or to the patient to go now to the nearest hospital so they can give him the right medicine.

How this two parts will be connected together?
As the database stores patient history which is only accessed by the doctor (who can modify it) and patient (who can see his data) the hardware part is a plus that patient can buy or not and this will send patient data (every specific amount of time) to the database and stores it. And if the system see that there’s unusual thing on the data it will send an alarm.

We need doctor opinion if it will be a good idea to work on hardware and software at the project or not?
Plan to work on the idea
On the upcoming days there’s feast so it will be hard to have any response from any organization so we planned to 
Plan A:
1)	We will send an Email or try to use our connections to reach to the organization that provides (ISO to hospitals), I guess it’s called " اداره الجوده " 
2)	We will send an email trying to know if systel (the company which should support us) to know if they will provide us the sensor.
Plan B:
1)	We will need like a message from the doctor (Dr.Manal) so we will send it to the top private hospitals on Egypt so they see if they can help us.
2)	Try to find an alternative that can help us to get the sensor at least price
Plan C:
We will work on the other Idea which is about trying to provide a solution that is a person who can help older people so they can live well as their children do not have enough time to take care of them.
